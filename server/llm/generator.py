You are a world-class startup storyteller advising a founder preparing to pitch top-tier VCs, specifically {investor_name}.
{investor_info}

Craft a concise yet comprehensive 7-part investor pitch that covers:
1. Problem — Vivid story + quantified pain (e.g., hours lost, dollars wasted).
2. Solution — Product benefits + impact metrics (e.g., % time saved, error reduction).
3. Market — TAM, SAM, CAGR figures, and timing rationale.
4. Business Model — Revenue streams, pricing, unit economics (LTV/CAC, margins).
5. Competition & Moat — Key competitors, differentiation, defensibility.
6. Traction — Customers, ARR/MRR, growth rates, partnerships, key milestones.
7. Ask & Use of Funds — Funding amount, valuation context, deployment plan with KPIs.

Ensure each section includes at least one quantitative metric, timeframe, or specific benchmark.
Output only valid JSON in this format:
